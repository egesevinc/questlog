# Questlog 🎮

**Letterboxd, but for games.** Log what you play, rate it, review it, and build lists — backed by a real game database and a clean, production-shaped .NET API.

> I'm a backend engineer, and I kept noticing that film lovers have Letterboxd, but gamers don't have an equivalent that feels good. So I built one as a hobby project — and used it as an excuse to build a properly-architected ASP.NET Core backend end to end: external API integration with caching, JWT auth, a thoughtful relational model, tests, and a one-command Docker setup.

---

## Why this exists / what it shows

This is a portfolio project, but it's built like a small real product rather than a tutorial. The interesting engineering is in the backend:

- **A real external integration done carefully.** Game data comes from [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/) (Twitch's game database). IGDB authenticates via Twitch OAuth2, blocks browser-origin requests, and rate-limits to 4 req/sec — so the app uses a server-side integration layer that handles token fetch/refresh, throttles outbound calls, and **read-through caches** games into Postgres so repeat lookups never touch IGDB.
- **A data model shaped for games, not films.** A game isn't watched once — it's played, abandoned, replayed, backlogged, or run for 200 hours. The core `GameLog` entity captures status, rating, hours played, and start/finish dates, with one log per user per game.
- **Clean architecture.** Domain → Application → Infrastructure → API, with dependencies pointing inward. Services depend on interfaces, not on EF Core or HttpContext, which keeps the core testable.
- **The unglamorous essentials.** JWT auth, BCrypt password hashing, centralized exception handling, EF Core migrations, meaningful unit tests, and Docker Compose.

                          └─────────────┬─────────────┘

              └───────┬──────────────────────────────┬─────────────┘
                      │                               │
              ┌───────▼────────┐            ┌─────────▼──────────┐
              │   PostgreSQL   │            │   IGDB API (Twitch)│
              │ (incl. game    │            │  search + details  │
              │  cache)        │            └────────────────────┘
              └────────────────┘
```

**Dependency rule:** `Domain` knows nothing about anyone. `Application` defines the contracts (`IIgdbClient`, `IGameService`, `ICurrentUser`). `Infrastructure` implements them. `Api` wires it together. You can swap Postgres or IGDB without touching business logic.

## The IGDB integration (the interesting part)

IGDB has three properties that make a naive client fail, and the design addresses each:

1. **Twitch OAuth2, token expires.** `TwitchTokenProvider` fetches an app access token and caches it in memory until just before it expires, refreshing on demand. A `SemaphoreSlim` prevents a stampede of token requests when several calls arrive after expiry.
2. **No browser-origin requests (CORS) + 4 req/sec limit.** All IGDB traffic goes through the server. `IgdbClient` caps concurrent outbound calls with a semaphore to stay inside the rate limit.
3. **Repeated lookups are wasteful.** `GameService` is **read-through cached**: search results and game details are upserted into Postgres, and detail reads are served locally while fresh (7-day TTL), so the same game is never fetched twice in a row. This also unlocks relational queries IGDB can't answer — e.g. a user's top genres across everything they've logged.

Secrets (`ClientId` / `ClientSecret`) are never committed; they're read from .NET user-secrets or environment variables.

## Data model

```
User ──< GameLog >── Game >──< Genre
 │  │      │           └──< Platform
 │  │      └── Review (1:1)
 │  └──< GameList ──< GameListItem >── Game
 └──< Follow >── User            (self-referencing, follower → followee)
```

- **GameLog** — the core: `Status` (Wishlist/Backlog/Playing/Completed/Abandoned/Replaying), `Rating` (1–10, nullable), `HoursPlayed`, `StartedAt`, `FinishedAt`. Unique index on `(UserId, GameId)`.
- **Game** — a local cache of IGDB metadata with many-to-many genres and platforms.
- **Review** — one per log, anchored to a specific playthrough.
- **GameList / GameListItem** — ordered, curated lists.
- **Follow** — a directed follow edge between two users; unique on `(FollowerId, FolloweeId)`. Powers the activity feed.

## Running it

### Option A — Docker (one command)

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in IGDB creds + a JWT secret
docker compose up --build
```

API → http://localhost:8080  ·  Swagger → http://localhost:8080/swagger

### Option B — Local dev

```bash
# 1. Start Postgres (or use the compose db service)
# 2. Set secrets — never commit these:
cd src/Questlog.Api
dotnet user-secrets set "Igdb:ClientId" "<your-twitch-client-id>"
dotnet user-secrets set "Igdb:ClientSecret" "<your-twitch-client-secret>"
dotnet user-secrets set "Jwt:Secret" "<a-long-random-string>"

# 3. Apply migrations + run
dotnet ef database update --project ../Questlog.Infrastructure --startup-project .
dotnet run
```

Get IGDB credentials free at the [Twitch developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console).

### Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

## What I'd build next

Treated as a roadmap, not a to-do — the v1 above is intentionally scoped to ship:

- **Likes & comments on reviews** to round out the social layer (following and an activity feed already ship — see the API surface).
- **Clips:** short vertical gameplay clips attached to logs — the long-term vision is a game-native feed where every clip is tied to the game it's from, which a generic video platform can't do.
- **Richer profiles:** year-in-review, "your gaming taste" summaries.
- **Caching upgrade:** move the token/game cache to Redis for multi-instance deploys.

## Notes

This is a personal project built for learning and as a portfolio piece. Game metadata is provided by IGDB under the Twitch Developer Service Agreement; Questlog is non-commercial.
